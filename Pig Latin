You have two friends who are speaking 
Pig Latin to each other! Pig Latin is the 
same words in the same order except that 
you take the first letter of each word 
and put it on the end, then you add 'ay'

Task
Your task is to take a sentence in English 
and turn it into the same sentence in 
Pig Latin!
